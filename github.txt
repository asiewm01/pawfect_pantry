1. Create the repo on GitHub
Go to: https://github.com/new

Repository name: something like ecommerce-django-react-docker

Keep it public or private (your choice)

Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (you already have those)

cd /c/Users/siewc/OneDrive/Desktop/Generation/Generation_Capstone_Ecommerce

# Remove the old Git history if any (since it's showing `master` at ~)
rm -rf .git

# Re-initialize Git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Dockerized full-stack ecommerce project"

# Add new GitHub repo URL
git remote add origin https://github.com/asiewm01/pawfect-pantry-capstone.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
